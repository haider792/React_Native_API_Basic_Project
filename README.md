# Can I use this as a base project?

Of course. Please remember though it is not a "fit all" solution and you'll need to configure it for your own project needs.

To change the name of the project, edit android/app/src/res/values/strings.xml. To change the launcher icon of the project, change all of the ic_launcher.png icons within android/app/src/res/mipmap-XXXX/.

This Android only demo app has been designed to be as minimal and basic as possible, to avoid confusion.

Key points:

It's only working on Android for now.
